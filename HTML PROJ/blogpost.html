                Maintaining a regular yoga practice can provide physical and mental health benefits
Learn about the different types of yoga and how it can be used as a tool to help you stay healthy.

Like yoga, the osteopathic approach to wellness focuses on your body‚Äôs natural tendency toward health and self-healing.

‚ÄúThe purpose of yoga is to build strength, awareness and harmony in both the mind and body,‚Äù explains Natalie Nevins, DO, a board-certified osteopathic family physician and certified Kundalini Yoga instructor in Hollywood, California.

While there are more than 100 different types, or schools, of yoga, most sessions typically include breathing exercises, meditation, and assuming postures (sometimes called asana or poses) that stretch and flex various muscle groups.

‚ÄúAs an osteopathic physician, I focus a lot of my efforts on preventive medicine and practices, and in the body‚Äôs ability to heal itself,‚Äù says Dr. Nevins. ‚ÄúYoga is a great tool for staying healthy because it‚Äôs based on similar principles.‚Äù

Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine‚Äã, or DOs, focus on prevention by examining how your lifestyle and environment impact your health, rather than just treating your symptoms.

Beginners welcome
Because there are so many different kinds of yoga practices, it is possible for anyone to start. ‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre a couch potato or a professional athlete, size and fitness levels do not matter because there are modifications for every yoga pose and beginner classes in every style,‚Äù says Dr. Nevins. ‚ÄúThe idea is to explore your limits, not strive for some pretzel-like perfection. It is a great way to get in tune with your body and your inner self.‚Äù‚Äã

Physical benefits
‚ÄúThe relaxation techniques incorporated in yoga can lessen chronic pain, such as lower back pain, arthritis, headaches and carpal tunnel syndrome,‚Äù explains Dr. Nevins. ‚ÄúYoga can also lower blood pressure and reduce insomnia.‚Äù

Other physical benefits of yoga include:

increased flexibility
increased muscle strength and tone
improved respiration, energy and vitality
maintaining a balanced metabolism
weight reduction
cardio and circulatory health
improved athletic performance
protection from injury
 

Mental benefits
Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. ‚ÄúStress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate,‚Äù says Dr. Nevins. ‚ÄúYoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.‚Äù

Yoga‚Äôs incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person‚Äôs mental well-being. ‚ÄúRegular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,‚Äù says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, ‚Äúbecause they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.
